\section*{Abstract}

The objective of this Project is to redesign the Wi-Fi network at Federico Santa Maria Technical University (UTFSM), 
to improve the performance to the end users. To achieve this, the first step to is collect information regarding 
the base situation; secondly, the making of a diagnosis in the current situation; third, a proposal of changes and 
evaluate this according to the diagnosis phase, and fourth, the planning, implementation and evaluation of the changes.

For the first phase it is noticed that the current IT department doesn't have a comprehensive survey of the devices 
that deliver the wireless service, so the gathering of information proceeds.

In the second phase, a diagnosis is performed to understand the reason behind the poor and unstable performance of the 
service, and proposing changes to mitigate this low performance.

Third, a simulator is built, that shows graphically a simulated coverage area inside a specific zone. Also, with this 
simulator some parameters that aid in this task of analysis and design of solution proposal are obtained.

Some metrics are defined to measure and compare the performance before and after the changes. Additionally, a different 
frequency assignment to the classic three orthogonal channels in the 2.4 [GHz] band is employed, using a four channel 
assignment that partially overlapping.

Finally the proposal solutions are planned and implemented, and a fully report to the IT department is delivered, with 
statistic and information updated of Wi-Fi service.
